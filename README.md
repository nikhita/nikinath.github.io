## Source code of my old blog

The old site was available at - https://nikinath.github.io/. However, luckily the Github username I wanted was available and I changed my username.

So now the website points to: https://nikhita.github.io/.

### How I built the site

Prior to building the new website, I was using the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme. I have written two detailed tutorials about how I had made the blog using Lanyon. They turned out to be quite useful while rebuilding the site! Here they are for your quick reference:

* [How to build a blog using Github, Jekyll and Lanyon](https://nikinath.github.io/build-blog-using-github-jekyll)
* [SEO for Jekyll blogs](https://nikinath.github.io/build-blog-using-github-jekyll) - if you have a jekyll blog, definitely read this!
