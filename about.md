Hi random stranger, welcome to my website!

I am Nikhita Raghunath, an undergraduate in Electronics Engineering from VJTI, Mumbai. Even though I am not a CS undergrad, I love programming and firmly believe that software development is much more than code - itâ€™s about people too.

As a student, my interests tend to vary but I am in love with systems programming. I also like coding in Rust and Go.

I write at my blog - have fun reading my posts and if you have questions, suggestions or just anything to say, please contact me!

You can find me at these places. Feel free to reach out to me. I don't bite! :)
