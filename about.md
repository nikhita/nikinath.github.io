<br>


I am Nikhita Raghunath, an undergraduate in Electronics Engineering from VJTI, Mumbai. Even though I am not a CS undergrad, I love programming and firmly believe that software development is much more than code - itâ€™s about building a diverse and inclusive community too.

I am fascinated by distributed systems, containers, cloud, linux, open source and more! I love programming in Go and have been delving into the DevOps ecosystem lately.

I write at my blog - if you have questions, suggestions or just anything to say, please contact me!

You can find me at these places. Feel free to reach out to me. I don't bite! :)
